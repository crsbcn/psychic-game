# The Psychic Game
## Revature Project "Zero" -- The Psychic Game

### Premise
The plot is simple. You are going up against three psychics who all have a letter in mind. You have seven attempts to guess which letter they picked, if you guess it right -- you win! Otherwise they prove their superiority to you and you have to try again. 

### Build

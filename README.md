# The Psychic Game
## Revature Project "Zero" -- The Psychic Game

#### 2019, Christopher Bacani. github.com/crsbcn

### Premise
The plot is simple. You are going up against three psychics who all have a letter in mind. You have ten attempts to guess which letter they picked, if you guess it right -- you win! Otherwise they prove their superiority to you and you have to try again. 

### Build
The build is simple, and it is a fun exercise anyone can do to get their creative engines re-sparked. HTML is used for the basic structure of the page. Bootstrap is used for the grid system and viewport responsiveness. Plain CSS is used to further manipulate the styling and Vanilla JS is used for the gameplay setup and functionality.

### Live Demo
The game is hosted on GitHub and its full funcationality can be demonstrated at https://crsbcn.github.io/psychic-game/ .

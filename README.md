## Revature Project "Zero" -- The Psychic Game

#### 2019, Christopher Bacani. github.com/crsbcn

### Premise
The plot is simple. You are going up against three psychics who all have a letter in mind. You have seven attempts to guess which letter they picked, if you guess it right -- you win! Otherwise they prove their superiority to you and you have to try again. 

### Build
The build is simple, and it is a fun exercise anyone can do to get their creative engines re-sparked. 
[HTML] -- Basic content and skeletal structure
[Bootstrap Grid System] -- Uniform style and layout. Extracted Bootstrap.min for the grid system and viewport responsiveness queries only.
[CSS3] -- Custom style manipulation
[Vanilla JS] -- Gameplay functionality


### Live Demo
The game is hosted on GitHub and its full funcationality can be demonstrated at https://crsbcn.github.io/psychic-game/ .
